## What is this project?

TITANS FTC team 19055's efforts to squash many years of experience into a library for FTC robots. Our aim is not only to provide a solid alternative to RoadRunner but also to allow teams (including ourselves) to use PurePursuit and provide many more utilities.

For now, the project is in a WIP stage and no versions are available yet.

## How is our RoadRunner replacement going to work?

This part of our codebase will be based on one of our alumni's work around wheeled robots motion planning linked here: [Vlad Chira's Path Planner](https://github.com/VladChira/pypathplanner/tree/master)
